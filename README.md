Introduction:
The program utilizes various machine learning models, including LSTM-based autoencoders, XGBoost regressors, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict future stock price movements. The ensemble approach combines these models to achieve a more robust and accurate forecasting mechanism.

Data Collection:
Historical stock price data for the company 'META' is collected using the Yahoo Finance API. The data is stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

Feature Engineering:
Technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are computed and added to the dataset for better model performance.

Target Variable Setup:
The target variable is defined as the difference between the adjusted closing price and the opening price of the stock. A binary classification ('TargetClass') is also created based on the direction of this difference.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualizations are provided to explore the distribution and trends of the target variable, offering insights into the dataset.

Scaling and Preprocessing:
Data is scaled using Min-Max scaling, and the dataset is split using TimeSeriesSplit for training and testing purposes.

LSTM-based Autoencoder:
A deep learning model with LSTM layers is implemented to capture temporal patterns in the data, enhancing feature representations.

XGBoost Regressor:
An XGBoost regressor is trained using the encoded representations from the autoencoder, contributing to the predictive ensemble.

LSTM Model:
A standalone LSTM model is created to further exploit temporal dependencies in the dataset.

Ensemble Approach:
The final predictions are generated by combining the outputs of the XGBoost regressor, SVM regressor, and the LSTM model, providing a more robust forecast.

Results and Evaluation:
Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are employed to assess the accuracy of individual models and the ensemble approach.

Conclusion:
The program showcases a holistic approach to stock price prediction, leveraging the strengths of various machine learning techniques. The ensemble model demonstrates improved accuracy, providing a valuable tool for financial analysts and investors.

Note: The provided code and analysis are for educational and experimental purposes. The predictive accuracy may vary based on data quality, market conditions, and other factors.
